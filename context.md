# History Management

The context bar consists of two components: a) a breadcrumb, and b) a navigation history. The breadcrumb displays the current navigation path, thus maintaining users' navigation context. Each component of the breadcrumb corresponds to a bin in the user's current navigation path. Therefore, users can visit any bins within the current navigation path by clicking on an appropriate component of the breadcrumb, without having to zoom in or zoom out. The System also maintains a list of recently visited bins (see Figure 6d). If aggregate columns are displayed along with the overview, contents of those columns are updated accordingly , as users revisit a bin.
