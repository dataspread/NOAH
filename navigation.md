# Navigational Operations
Users can navigate the spreadsheet by interacting with the bins of the overview via clicking and semantic zooming operations.

## Clicking
When a user clicks on a specific bin, the system displays the corresponding spreadsheet data; users can use this to jump to a specific spreadsheet location without having to scroll endlessly. For example, in Figure 2b, as the user clicks on the Boston bin, the data corresponding to Boston is displayed (Figure 2c).

## Semantic Zooming
Users can zoom into a specific bin to view more fine-grained information or zoom out to view a more coarse-grained information, via semantic zooming. For example, in Figure 2a, from the bin Ashville-Boston when the user zooms in to the next level, the system displays the bins Ashville, Austin, and Boston (Figure 2b). If the user zooms out of the current granularity, again the system displays the bins Ashville-Boston, Chicago-Denver, and others. Users can only zoom into any bin that contains multiple unique values.
